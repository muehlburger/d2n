d2n adds timestamps in ISO 8601+ format
YYYY-MM-DD (http://datestamps.org/index.shtml) at the beginning of
the filenames to files. d2n is inspired by Karl Voit's article on "[Managing Digital Files]" and his [date2name] tool but not 100% compatible.

If the timestamp exists at the beginning of the filename, it will be ignored. Executed with an examplefilename of "image.jpg", it results in "2006-01-02T15.04.05 image.jpg".

Note: Other that defined in ISO 8601+ the delimiter between hours,
minutes, and seconds is not a colon but a dot. Colons are causing
several problems on different file systems and are therefore replaced
with the (older) DIN 5008 version with dots. (see [date2name] for more information).
